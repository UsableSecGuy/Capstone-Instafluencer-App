# Instafluencer App: Full Stack Nano - Capstone Project

## About

Influencer Marketing has become a growing part of many marketing programs. The goal is to find someone with a decent-sized, highly engaged following on various social media platforms to share your product with their audience. The larger the following and higher the engagement, the more influencers will charge. Smaller businesses often have limited funds and focus on leveraging nano-influencers (1,000-10,000 followers). Smaller audiences can often mean higher engagement rates.

The goal of the Instafluencer App is to allow marketers to search for Instagram nano-influencers with high engagement raters.

The Instafluencer application:

1. Searches its own database for Instafluencers by hashtag.
2. Save lists of Instafluencers.
3. Present Instafluencers in order of highest engagement.


## About the Stack

There is a full backend but a frontend was not required for this assignment (frontend may be added later). It is designed with some key functional areas:


### Backend

The `./backend` directory contains a completed Flask server with a written SQLAlchemy module, required endpoints, configure, and integrate Auth0 for authentication.

[View the README.md within ./backend for more details.](./backend/README.md)

## Running The Server (on Heroku)

The application is live on Heroku. Point your custom cURL or Postman requests [https://instafluencer.herokuapp.com/](https://instafluencer.herokuapp.com/).
